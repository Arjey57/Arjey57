- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Arjey57
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Arduino in combination with hardware for stearing anything I build in my workshop (f.e. the FS2020, but many other things too)...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m still learning Arduino and its programming (never ending story I guess).
      I'm an retired engineer for 3D measuring with a specil software. Besides I did programming in VB6 
      I own some tools for working with wood and metal and I own a 3D printer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... Isn't here something like an internal mail?
